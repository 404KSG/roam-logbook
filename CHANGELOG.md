# Changelog

## 0.9.0-beta.3 — 2026-08-15

- Kept the Logbook topbar unit stable while Roam Search expands or the window narrows.
- Added a singleton Shift+Click **Current Sessions** panel in Roam's right sidebar, using the same view model and renderer as the popover.
- Moved Refresh into each surface header and replaced the ambiguous per-row stop icon with an explicit **Check Out** action.
- Preserved paused batch rows in place, added deterministic reconciliation for explicit clock-in/out during a pause, and kept retryable partial results visible.
- Added high-DPI/narrow-width geometry and sidebar lifecycle/accessibility coverage; the suite now contains 212 tests.
